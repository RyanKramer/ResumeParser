With extensive experience in high growth urban areas, Cooke has provided myriad local government services to the City of Charlotte and Wake County, both in North Carolina. His experience includes managing large public organizations with growing capital infrastructure and daily public service needs. The City of Charlotte is approaching 800,000 in population and Wake County is approaching one million citizens. In January 2014, he was hired by Mulkey Engineers and Consultants, a full service civil engineering firm located in Cary, N.C., to be its newest principal and director of business development. As county manager for Wake County he oversaw an organization of 3,600 employees with a $1.2 billion operating budget. Cooke was instrumental in leading 13 successful bond referenda, and helped recruit companies like Fidelity Investments, Novartis, and Metlife to Wake County. He successfully implemented partnerships with municipalities, including the development and operation of a regional landfill, the planning and implementation of the Raleigh Convention Center, the Neuse River Greenway, open space acquisitions, and public safety communications. Cooke received his undergraduate from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1982 and continued at the university to receive a masters in public administration in 1984.

As the citys chief administrator, the city manager is responsible for making city government run efficiently and economically. The city manager serves and advises the mayor and City Council, appoints most department directors and prepares a proposed annual budget for council consideration. The manager also enforces municipal laws and ordinances and coordinates City operations and programs. The manager does not appoint the police chief or the parks and recreation director, who are appointed instead by the boards they serve. The City Managers Office provides staff support services to the City Council and its committee meetings, and coordinates the development and analysis of policy recommendations presented to the mayor and City Council. The city manager interacts on a daily basis with the Citys Executive Team, consisting of the City Managers Office administrative staff and his department liaisons, department directors (including the chief of police and parks and recreation director, who are appointed by separate boards) and the city auditor and city clerk, who are appointed by the City Council.

The city of Laredo has been without a permanent city manager for four months. In that time, the job has fallen to an interim, or acting city manager, but now, the city has filled the position. A city manager search that yielded 47 applicants was cut to nine. That list was cut to three. After one-on-one interviews, in executive session, the Laredo city council voted unanimously to hire ""interim"" city manager Jesus Olivares. ""He brings with him this great experience from out of town, but then he also brings with him this great experience of being with Laredo"", said Council member, Roberto Balli. Council member Roberto Balli made the motion to select Olivares. He says Olivares, with more than 20 years of experience, including being the former city manager of Eagle Pass is right for the job. ""The city has been managed effectively for the past couple of months"", said Olivares. Olivares says he'll pick-up as city manager, where he left-off as ""interim"" city manager. ""We're working on a comprehensive plan, we're looking at all the transportation issues, we're looking at the environment, we're looking at housing issues, we're looking at how we can generate economic development in this community"", said Olivares. The position of Laredo city manager makes more than $200,000 and they oversee all Laredo employees under the direction of the city council. ""He's also someone who can get started right away because of his experience here with the city"", said Council member, Roberto Balli. Olivares says he plans to move ahead with plans for a new cemetery, landfill and improvements to the loop. As for how long he'll stay in the position, Olivaes says it's hard to say. ""These positions are not long-lived. What we want to make sure that we do is that we work very closely with mayor and council. And that we get the things done that we need to be done. And at some point new council members, new managers and new staff will come in. And hopefully the pathway that we laid down will be followed by future generations"", said Olivares. The council approved renewing the salary of former city manager Carlos Villarreal. That's $242,000 per year. In addition, the position also comes with a car and cell phone allowance. The city council will work out a benefits package at an upcoming city council meeting. The city's human resources director says terms for the length of a contract may also be figured out at that time. 	 ","464.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"74","../data/input/example_resumes/city of union city, CA.pdf","Antonio E. Acosta, City Manager The City Manager serves as the chief executive officer of the City and is responsible for managing and coordinating all day-to-day operations and administration. Duties include personnel and labor relations, the preparation and administration of the city budget, intergovernmental relations and organizing and implementing the City Council's policies. The City Manager is hired by the City Council and serves as the council's chief advisor. Union City starts 2015 with a fresh outlook from newly-appointed Interim City Manager Antonio E. Acosta (warmly known as Tony by City staff, City Council and community members). City Council voted unanimously to appoint Mr. Acosta to oversee a full-time staff of 217 city employees and an annual operating budget of $45 million. His primary focus in leading the City will be to implement strong economic development initiatives, improve internal communication and community engagement, and to establish marketing strategies that make Union City a sought- after destination for families, visitors and businesses. While Mr. Acosta is new to the position of City Manager, he is not new to Union City. He is a long-time resident of Union City and formerly served as the Citys Deputy City Manager since 2001. In this role, he spearheaded the development of social programs benefitting community members, such as the Youth Violence Prevention and Intervention Program and the New Haven Unified School Districts Kids Zone program. He also championed successful ballot measures that stabilized City revenues over the last several years. Previous to Union City, Mr. Acosta had a 23-year career with the City of Oakland where he rose through the ranks to eventually serve as the Director of Parks and Recreation. During this time, Mr. Acosta most notably worked with East Bay Regional Park District staff to develop and implement effective vegetation management controls in the Oakland Hills in response to the 1991 Oakland Tunnel Fire and served as the lead staff support in the development of the Metropolitan Links Golf Course. Without a doubt, community members, local elected officials and City staff anticipate great progress in 2015 with Tony leading the charge. 	 	 ANTONIO E.
