Andrzejewski, who has been city manager of Menominee, Michigan, since February 2013, has accepted the Canandaigua's city manager position. His official starting date will be announced in April. Andrzejewski grew up in North Tonawanda and went to the University of Buffalo. His first job was in Olean, where he met his wife, Patricia. ""I'm very excited,"" Andrzejewski said. ""I like the city. I like the lake. I like the atmosphere and I like the people. It's just wonderful."" Andrzejewski was selected from more than 55 candidates that included several local ones, including acting City Manager John Goodwin, who has been assistant city manager since September 2014. Goodwin declined to comment. Mayor Ellen Polimeni said she and City Council express sincere appreciation for the ""remarkable work"" Goodwin has done over the past two months. ""He has demonstrated leadership during this transition period, and we appreciate his contributions to city issues during this transition period,"" Polimeni said. Former City Manager David Forrest announced his resignation last year and held the position until the end of 2015. Prior to holding the Menominee position, Andrzejewski served nine years as elected mayor in Eastlake, Ohio, and one as councilman.

With extensive experience in high growth urban areas, Cooke has provided myriad local government services to the City of Charlotte and Wake County, both in North Carolina. His experience includes managing large public organizations with growing capital infrastructure and daily public service needs. The City of Charlotte is approaching 800,000 in population and Wake County is approaching one million citizens.

He successfully implemented partnerships with municipalities, including the development and operation of a regional landfill, the planning and implementation of the Raleigh Convention Center, the Neuse River Greenway, open space acquisitions, and public safety communications.

I moved here due to my wife's heat allergy, as we sought a place with temperate weather and a little less sun. Moving to the foothills of the Cascades has been moving to our own paradise. It is one of the best places on Earth. Before moving to Issaquah, we lived in Wyoming, Ohio, (8,300) which is one of the quaintest and friendliest small towns in America. The City was rife with historic Victorian homes, the best School District in Ohio, and was likely one of the most democratic cities in America. Citizen involvement was the business of the community. I have been fortunate in my career that I have worked in some of the best cities in America, including Wauwatosa and Whitefish Bay Wisconsin. Professionally, I have been elected as a ICMA Vice President - West Coast with my term beginning in 2013. I have appreciated the opportunity to serve in a variety of volunteer positions with ICMA, as outlined in my ICMA profile. I have also served as the President of the Ohio City Management Association and on the Board of the OCMA for several years from 2005 to 2010. I am also co-chairing the 2015 ICMA Conference Host Committee with Doug Schulze, City Manager of Bainbridge Island (a very innovative City Manager). I have benefited from many mentors in my career and hope to return their support of me to other younger professionals who hope to break into this honorable profession.

The city of Laredo has been without a permanent city manager for four months. In that time, the job has fallen to an interim, or acting city manager, but now, the city has filled the position. A city manager search that yielded 47 applicants was cut to nine. That list was cut to three. After one-on-one interviews, in executive session, the Laredo city council voted unanimously to hire ""interim"" city manager Jesus Olivares. ""He brings with him this great experience from out of town, but then he also brings with him this great experience of being with Laredo"", said Council member, Roberto Balli. Council member Roberto Balli made the motion to select Olivares. He says Olivares, with more than 20 years of experience, including being the former city manager of Eagle Pass is right for the job. ""The city has been managed effectively for the past couple of months"", said Olivares. Olivares says he'll pick-up as city manager, where he left-off as ""interim"" city manager. ""We're working on a comprehensive plan, we're looking at all the transportation issues, we're looking at the environment, we're looking at housing issues, we're looking at how we can generate economic development in this community"", said Olivares. The position of Laredo city manager makes more than $200,000 and they oversee all Laredo employees under the direction of the city council. ""He's also someone who can get started right away because of his experience here with the city"", said Council member, Roberto Balli. Olivares says he plans to move ahead with plans for a new cemetery, landfill and improvements to the loop. As for how long he'll stay in the position, Olivaes says it's hard to say. ""These positions are not long-lived. What we want to make sure that we do is that we work very closely with mayor and council. And that we get the things done that we need to be done. And at some point new council members, new managers and new staff will come in. And hopefully the pathway that we laid down will be followed by future generations"", said Olivares. The council approved renewing the salary of former city manager Carlos Villarreal. That's $242,000 per year. In addition, the position also comes with a car and cell phone allowance. The city council will work out a benefits package at an upcoming city council meeting.

Hernstadt City Manager Roger T. Hernstadt was appointed by city council as the City Manager on January 31, 2014. His selection was based upon his extensive public administration experience necessary to meet the challenge of managing a dynamic coastal community where small-town ambiance meets 21st century technology. Roger has over 34 years of public administration experience. He began his career in 1980 as the Code Compliance Manager for the Public Works Department in Miami-Dade County, Florida. He was subsequently promoted to positions of increasing responsibility, including the Chief of Causeways and Special Taxing Districts, Chief of Public Services and Administration and Assistant Director of Public Works. Roger credits the lessons and experience gained from coming up the ranks in the Public Works Department with providing an excellent professional background in working with large staffs, architects, engineers, contractors and consultants. In 1990, Roger was promoted to the Miami-Dade County Managers Office where he served as the Capital Improvement Coordinator and the Director of the Office of Capital Improvements. During this time he managed numerous multi-billion dollar infrastructure improvements, all at a substantial cost savings to the citizens. In 2007, Roger was hired as the Assistant City Manager/Chief of Staff for the City of Miami, Florida. Working with other mayors and managers, he witnessed firsthand their styles and approaches to the challenges they faced  political, personnel, administration, management and budget; thus strengthening his ability to listen, identify the limiting factors, build a consensus and solve the problem. In 2010, he was chosen from a pool of 95 candidates as the City Manager of Marathon, Florida, where he served with distinction until he was recruited to be the next city manager of Marco Island. Rogers professional management style can be summed up by his personal motto: Good enough never is! Roger earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Brooklyn College in New York and a Master of Public Administration degree from the University of Miami. He also attended the public administration, management decision making and leadership seminars conducted by the John F. Kennedy School of Government (Harvard University). Roger lives on Marco Island with his wife Jessica, a real estate attorney, and stepson Aidan. His eldest son, Mathew, is a recent Florida State University graduate and an accountant in Fort Lauderdale. In their free time, they enjoy coastal living, boating, fishing and golfing, and look forward to family vacations throughout the US and abroad. 	 ",450,239-389-5000,239,rhernstadt@cityofmarcoisland.com,cityofmarcoisland.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,362,../data/input/example_resumes/City of Margate FL.pdf,"Mr. Douglas (Doug) Smith Member City Manager City of Margate Margate FL United States PHONE (954) 935-5300 FAX (954) 935-5304 EMAIL dsmith@margatefl.com WEBSITE www.mydelraybeach.com OverviewQuestions WORK City Manager's Office City of Margate 5790 Margate Blvd Margate, FL 33063-3614 United States GROUPS Alliance for Innovation Development This group has been created for Alliance for Innovation members to discuss community and economic development issues. 5440 members Alliance for Innovation Management & Innovation Group This group is for Alliance for Innovation members to discuss management and innovation issues, strategies, practices and techniques.

By Tim Freed  September 11, 2013 8:32 p.m.  Archive Share  inShare Oviedo interim city manager Bryan Cobb received an unexpected gift on the night of his most recent birthday, which fell on Thursdays budget hearing meeting: an offer to take up the mantle as the permanent city manager  a position thats been transient for nearly a decade. The new job would be a dream come true for Cobb, who began working for the city in 1995 as a senior planner and always aspired to work as the city manager. From his start in the mid-90s to 2011, Cobb worked his way up the ranks with four different promotions, holding the title of development review manager, planning director, development services director and then assistant city manager. It wasnt until this April when former city manager Kathryn Breazeale resigned that Cobb stepped up as interim city manager, a position hes held up until Thursday. Its what Ive always wanted to do, this is what Ive been working for, Cobb said. The offer for the permanent position, brought up Councilman Stephen Schenck during the final minutes of the meeting, came as a shock to Cobb. Id like for us to consider when were going to take off the interim tag on Mr. Cobb, Schenck said. Im all in favor of the great job that Mr. Cobb has been doing. Oviedos city manager position has proven to be anything but permanent over the past several years. Former city manager Gerald Seeber resigned in January of 2008 after a four-year tenure, leaving the city without a permanent manager for six months. A stalled hiring and an interim city manager eventually led to Richard Gestrich getting the job in July of that year. He then resigned three years later, despite the claims that hed retire in Oviedo. Its not that they didnt love Oviedo, said Mayor Dominic Persampiere in regards to the previous city managers. Its just that it was more of a career choice for them. But each time a city manager left, the Council would insist on hiring from outside the city, leaving Cobb with a new boss who would later quit and start the cycle over again. Persampiere said that Cobb brings a passion and knowledge to the position that the city hasnt seen in years. Mr. Cobb has served the city faithfully for well over 15 years, Persampiere said. There isnt anybody more qualified than Bryan to take the helm and lead the city for the next 10 years or so. The greatest asset with Mr. Cobb is that hes part of the community  weve kind of come full-circle. Cobb recalls coming to Oviedo with his wife in 1995 and immediately falling in love with the family-friendly city. A city hes continued to serve ever since. I appreciate that the Council has faith in me, Cobb said. I love serving this city, and thats what I do. Cobb and city attorney Lonnie Groot are putting together a city manager contract, which will be presented before the Council at a future meeting within the next 30 days, Persampiere said. 	 ",549,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,455,../data/input/example_resumes/City of Owosso.pdf,"Mr. Donald (Don) D.

Stockton and also havingbeen the City Manager there. After graduating High School in Ft. Stockton, Daniel served a tour in the U.S. Army, and was honorably discharged in 1993. He then spent time attending to family matters before enrolling in Texas Tech University, obtaining a Masters of Business Administration in 2000. He was subsequently employed as a business and accounting instructor at Midland College Regional Technical Training Center while also working as the CFO, and later, Unit Health Administrator for Pecos County Memorial Hospital. From 2003 to 2007 Daniel served as City Manager for Fort Stockton, where his accomplishments included designing and implementing the citys strategic turn-around plan, bringing about a deficit reduction of 40%, placing the City in the black and keeping it there for four straight years after the city had run at a deficit for the previous five years. Daniel then moved on to the City of Eagle Pass where he served as City Manager from July 2008 until he was chosen as the City Manager for the City of San Angelo in September of 2012. Daniels accomplishments in Eagle Pass included facilitating a fund balance increase of $2.8 Million in spite of having lost $800,000 in revenues via the bridge enterprise fund, planning and implementing a new waste collection system which eliminated a $500,000 per year budget shortfall and ultimately netted a profit of $1.3 million per year. Daniel was also instrumental in streamlining many of the Citys processes to help make the city run more efficiently. For his efforts, Daniel was named Public Manager of the Year for 2011 by the Eagle Pass Business Journal. In his new role, as San Angelo City Manager, Daniel is working toward implementing and accomplishing 5 major goals as established by the city council to address water, streets, competitive salaries, improved development services and a new police facility.See more Experience Mr. Daniel Valenzuela City Manager City of San Angelo San Angelo TX United States  City Manager Company NameCity of San Angelo Dates EmployedOct 2012  Present Employment Duration4 yrs 4 mos LocationSan Angelo, Texas Area Serve as the Chief Executive/Administrative Officer as appointed by the Mayor and City Council See lessSee less City Manager, City of San Angelo  City Manager Company NameCity of Eagle Pass Dates EmployedJul 2008  Oct 2012 Employment Duration4 yrs 4 mos LocationEagle Pass, Texas Served as Chief Executive/Administrative Officer as appointed by Mayor and City Council See lessSee less City Manager, City of Eagle Pass  City Manager Company NameCity of Fort Stockton Dates EmployedOct 2003  Nov 2007 Employment Duration4 yrs 2 mos LocationFort Stockton, Texas Served as Chief Executive/Administrative Officer as appointed by Mayor and City Council See lessSee less City Manager, City of Fort Stockton Education  Texas Tech University Degree NameMaster of Business Administration (M.B.A.) Dates attended or expected graduation1996  2000 Activities and Societies: Beta Gamma Sigma - Premier International Honor Society for Business; Sigma Iota Epsilon - National Honorary and Professional Management Fraternity ",528,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,537,../data/input/example_resumes/city of san antonio.pdf,"Ms. Sheryl L.

Duties include personnel and labor relations, the preparation and administration of the city budget, intergovernmental relations and organizing and implementing the City Council's policies. The City Manager is hired by the City Council and serves as the council's chief advisor. Union City starts 2015 with a fresh outlook from newly-appointed Interim City Manager Antonio E. Acosta (warmly known as Tony by City staff, City Council and community members). City Council voted unanimously to appoint Mr. Acosta to oversee a full-time staff of 217 city employees and an annual operating budget of $45 million. His primary focus in leading the City will be to implement strong economic development initiatives, improve internal communication and community engagement, and to establish marketing strategies that make Union City a sought- after destination for families, visitors and businesses. While Mr. Acosta is new to the position of City Manager, he is not new to Union City. He is a long-time resident of Union City and formerly served as the Citys Deputy City Manager since 2001. In this role, he spearheaded the development of social programs benefitting community members, such as the Youth Violence Prevention and Intervention Program and the New Haven Unified School Districts Kids Zone program. He also championed successful ballot measures that stabilized City revenues over the last several years. Previous to Union City, Mr. Acosta had a 23-year career with the City of Oakland where he rose through the ranks to eventually serve as the Director of Parks and Recreation. During this time, Mr. Acosta most notably worked with East Bay Regional Park District staff to develop and implement effective vegetation management controls in the Oakland Hills in response to the 1991 Oakland Tunnel Fire and served as the lead staff support in the development of the Metropolitan Links Golf Course. Without a doubt, community members, local elected officials and City staff anticipate great progress in 2015 with Tony leading the charge. 	 	 ANTONIO E.

(Matt) M. Belcher City Manager City of Winchester Winchester KY New Winchester city manager hired April 17, 2013|By Kendall Sparks | The Winchester Sun 	 The Winchester Board of Commissioner voted unanimously Tuesday evening to hire Matt Belcher as the new city manager. Belcher worked as assistant city manager in Paris for three years before serving as the economic development director in Lincoln County. Im confident that Matt will do a good job, said Winchester Mayor Ed Burtner. Burtner said between 30 and 40 people applied for the city manager position and the city commission interviewed five candidates. Belcher had diverse experience, which includes serving as Winchesters interim city manager for five months in early 2006, he said. Im very excited about the opportunity, Belcher said this morning. Im looking forward to getting to work and doing the citys business and making sure we are using what resources we have in the most efficient and effective manner in terms of the people. Belcher also said he would see to day-to-day operations and continue the things that have been done in the past. He said he hopes to be a small part of the continued progress in the community under the city commissioners and the mayor. Belcher resigned from his position in Lincoln County before the Winchester City Commission voted on his employment. Burtner said it was a timing issue in which Belcher had to resign at the final meeting in Lincoln County before the commissions next meeting in which they would vote. He said the job was offered to him and he would not have put in his notice without knowing this, and that he had to be fair to his current employer by giving them time. Burtner also said the city was very fortunate to have J.R. Wilhite, who became interim city manager following former city manager Ken Kerns retirement in December 2012. Belchers resignation from Lincoln County is effective May 3 and his first day as city manager will be May 6. In other business: The commission heard a annual progress report presentation on the Tax Increment Financing (TIF) project at Winchester Plaza by Clark County Economic Development Director Todd Denham. Denham said there will be a new Japanese restaurant opening in the Winchester Plaza and other facilities are looking to move in. The commission recognized the Clark County Alcohol Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) Youth Network for their awards in the 2012 Keep Kids SaFe Public Service Announcement Contest. The students won three first place awards in three separate categories for educational videos related to drug and alcohol abuse. Toniya Coles of Winchester was recognized for her work as Miss Clark County Plus America and Mrs. Kentucky Plus America through the program No Child Left Hungry. Coles was presented a key to the city by Burtner and the city commissioners.  The commission passed a motion to allow the organizers of the March for Jesus event to hold the march on city streets on May 18. Twenty-six churches are currently involved.  The commission passed a motion for Ken Catron of Columbia Gas to hold a walk to raise awareness to call before you dig on May 5.

When I was 11, we moved to Tyler, Texas, where my stepfather worked with his three brothers building new homes. At that time, all work from framing to cabinetry was done at the job site, and I learned carpentry skills at an early age. I worked my way through college, and I graduated from Stephen F. Austin with a BBA as an accounting major with nearly enough semester hours to earn a minor in Spanish. My first job out of college was as a tax auditor with the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts in Odessa, Texas. I then moved with my wife and infant son to Austin and became a budget analyst for a defense contractor, Tracor Aerospace Austin. The companys most profitable segment was the manufacturing of chaff and flair for military aircraft, including fighter jets. My mother-in-law was the director of the Travis County Housing Authority, and through her, I developed an interest in local government. She suggested that I get my masters degree in public administration, and I moved to Tucson, Arizona in 1988 to attend graduate school at the University of Arizona. I graduated with a 4.0 GPA. During my career as a finance director, assistant town manager, and town manager. I have learned a tremendous amount, including council/manager relations, community and public relations, strategic planning, financial management, economic development, operations, staff relations and employee development, and intergovernmental and legislative relations, among others. I enjoy hiking, running, strength training, golf, and kyaking. My wife and I have three grown children: a daughter in Tucson, a son in Tempe, and a daughter in New York. We share our home with our two rescued dogs.

After earning a Bachelor degree in Economics and Political Science from Indiana University in 1993, Andrew began his career in economic and community development in his home town of Fort Wayne, Indiana. Working for the Allen County Department of Planning Services, Andrew engaged in all aspects of economic development work including: policy research, business incentives, and infrastructure development. During that time, Andrew also earned his Master of Public Affairs degree from Indiana Universitys School of Public and Environmental Affairs and was inducted into Pi Alpha Alpha, the Global Honor Society for Public Affairs and Administration. In 1999, Andrew joined the Indiana Economic Development Council, a state sponsored economic development think tank, where he facilitated community strategic planning efforts in multiple regions across Indiana. In 2001, Andrew attended the Robert H. McKinney School of Law where he earned a Doctorate of Jurisprudence cum laude. Returning to state government, Andrews legal career began with the Indiana Gaming Commission, where he was promptly promoted to Deputy General Counsel. Three years later, Andrew joined the State Lottery Commission as its General Counsel and served in that capacity for over four years. Desiring a return to local government and economic development related work, Andrew accepted an appointment in 2013 to serve as Town Manager for the Town of Cumberland, an edge community on the east side of Indianapolis. In 2015, Andrew accepted the same position for the Town of Plainfield, Indiana, which is the third largest town in Indiana. Andrew works to efficiently manage town services, build community pride, and foster value-added development and infrastructure improvements for the Town. Andrew has served as an intake attorney for the Neighborhood Christian Legal Clinic and currently sits on the board for FAME, a non-profit organization that provides medical supplies and resources as well as short term medical missions to developing countries. In his down time, Andrew enjoys spending time with his family, watching football, and working on home improvement projects.

Throughout my career as a public servant, I have always understood the value of public involvement and advocacy. Over the past few years, I have sought out every opportunity to fine-tune my career path to gain a strong understanding of sustainable community stewardship. To assist with this personal goal, I studied to become a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Accredited Professional (LEED AP). In addition, I maintain an ICMA Credentialed Manager (CM) designation. I have had the opportunity to speak at the IAPD Conference, the ARRA Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Workshop, the CMAP Green Practices for Local Government Series, the Sustainable Cities Symposium and the APA Innovative Transit Initiatives Open House. I also served on the Advisory Committee for University of Illinois Extension's first Environmental Leadership Conference. In addition to speaking engagements, I had a professional article published in PM Magazine outlining the benefits of hiring returning military veterans.
